# Ariadne-String

Ariadne-String will convert an image to a string art pattern. 

It is inspired by the amazing work done by [Petros Vrellis](http://artof01.com/vrellis/). Checkout his projects and take a look at [this video](https://vimeo.com/175653201) to get an idea what this software tries to reproduce and accomplish.

The starting point of this project is a clone of [Strixel from Wose](https://github.com/wose/Strixel). Thanks you Wose to allow me to clone Strixel repository.

## Usage

Works only with square images at the moment.

```shell
% ./Ariadne-String image.jpg
```

```shell
% git clone --recursive -j4 https://github.com/onverra/Ariadne-String.git
